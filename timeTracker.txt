initialise a default ESlint: node_modules/.bin/eslint --init
to watch test use command line: npm run test -- --watch
run a single test, use this command line: npm test -- -t 'when list has only one blog, equals the likes of that' or npm test -- tests/note_api.test.js

how powerful reduce method : to add up, to compare array of objects.

4.6 - 35mins + 45 mins (as misunderstood)
//===============//
when use REDUCE --> RETURN THE RESULT OF REDUCE METHOD, NOT INSIDE THE METHOD
Lodash library: 
    Lodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc.
    Lodashâ€™s modular methods are used for:
        -- Iterating arrays, objects, & strings
        -- Manipulating & testing values
        -- Creating composite functions
misunderstood the argument - so need to fix the function mostBlog - took additional 45mins

really hard to re-structure the data.
learned how powerful reduce method is --> however still not 100% confident using it T_T

4.8 to 4.12 - 9h30
//=============//
for backend testing, can use mocking database library from : https://github.com/williamkapke/mongo-mock
runInBand option in test script in package.json : to prevent Jest from running tests in parallel
specified the mode of application in the script may not work in Windows. by installing cross-env package and update script, issue is solved
test env should use different database from live env
SUPERTEST package can be used for writing tests for testing API
cant update npm on Mac with missing access error --> this may help https://flaviocopes.com/npm-fix-missing-write-access-error/
to test Mongoose with Jest, need to create a jest.config.js file and define the test env.can be found here: https://mongoosejs.com/docs/jest.html
4.8 - 6h
4.9 - 30mins
DeprecationWarning: Listening to events on the Db class has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major version -> down grade mongoose by running npm i mongoose@5.11.15
Testing api which is connected to database, better to call the connect method in the test before the test -> works more consistent 
Use express-async-errors to handle errors in async functions
4.10 to 4.12 -  3h
4.13 - 3h somehow the express-async-errors does not catch errors when call delete request with invalid id :(
4.14 - 1.5h completed what was asked + plus the route to get a single post and its test

4.15 to 4.16 - 3h
4.17 - 4h
